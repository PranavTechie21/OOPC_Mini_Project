# 🚗 Car Rental System

A simple **Car Rental System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (OOPC) in C++**. This project demonstrates a **step-by-step layered implementation** from blueprint to a fully functional system with **booking summary generation**.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Car Rental System** allows users to:

* 🔍 Browse available cars
* 📝 Book a car by providing details
* 💰 Calculate total rental cost
* 📄 Generate a booking summary stored in a text file

This project is structured into **five demo files**, where each demo introduces new **OOP concepts** and adds functionality, leading to the **final integrated project**.
