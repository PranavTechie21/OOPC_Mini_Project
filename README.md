### 🚗 Car Rental System

A simple **Car Rental System** built using Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (OOPC) in C++. This project demonstrates step-by-step implementation from blueprint to a fully functional system with booking summary generation.

---

## 📖 Overview

The Car Rental System allows users to:

* Browse available cars
* Book a car by providing details
* Calculate total rental cost
* Generate a booking summary stored in a text file

This project showcases layered implementation through **five demo files**, each adding new OOP concepts and functionality, leading to the final integrated project.
